Descriptive feature naming conventions:

From features.txt I have made the following transformations: 

t => Time
f => Freq

Body => Body (body acceleration)
Gravity => Gravity (gravity acceleration)

Acc => Accelerometer
Gyro => Gyroscope

Jerk => Jerk (body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived in time)
Mag => Magnitude (magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm)

XYZ => XYZ (3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions)

mean() => Mean
std() => Std (Standard deviation)

Each part of the descriptive name is separated with dot (.)
